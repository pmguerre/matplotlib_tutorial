# Matplotlib Tutorial

These are the jupyter notebooks that I've made by watching the Matplotlib Tutorials by Corey Schafer. Here are the links to the series [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO98lJQ3QGI&list=PL-osiE80TeTvipOqomVEeZ1HRrcEvtZB_), and the [Github repository](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Python/Matplotlib)

Kudos to him
